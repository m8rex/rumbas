# Rumbas (Rust + Numbas)

## What is Rumbas ?

- A system to create online exercises, build on top of numbas.
- Text-based: yaml (and html and tex) specifications are converted to html files (e.g. scorm package)
  - So git can be used for version control ðŸŽ‰ 
- Consistent naming of fields in the yaml (not the case in the json of numbas)
- Written in Rust
- Preferred way to use it is docker
- Currently in beta, not all features are implemented yet.

## Folder structure
A rumbas project should have to following folder structure:
  - A folder named `default` that contains the default specifications
  - A folder named `questions` that contains the questions
  - A folder named `exams` that contains the exams
  - A folder named `themes` the contains the themes
  - A folder named `template_questions` that contains templates for questions
  - A folder named `template_exams` that contains the template for exams
  - A folder named `custom_part_types` that contains `custom_part_types`

Rumbas does not specify default values by itself:
  - Users can (and should) use the `default` folder to specify their own default versions for different settings
  - By doing this, their question and exam specifications become much more concise.
  - Users can also create multiple versions of the default settings (e.g. a default setting for practice exams and a default setting for real exams)

The html input can be specified in two ways:
  - inline in the yaml,
  - in a separate html file (Recommended for larger htmls)
      - The value of the yaml field should then equal `file:<path to filename in questions folder>`
This is will also be possible for the description of functions

Functions can be specified by just a filename:
  - Not yet implemented
  - Language is taken from the extension (`js` or `jme`)
  - file should start with comments of form `# param <name> <type>`
  - next should be the real definition

Templating is possible:
  - Templates should be placed in the `template_questions`/`template_exams` folder
    - These files look like ordinary question/exam files
    - Contains strings like `"template:<name>" as value for some fields (e.g. `"template:equation"`)
  - `Values files` should be placed in the `questions`/`exams` folder
    - Contains a `template` field which specifies the template. This path is relative within `template_questions`/`template_exams`
    - Contains a field for every template variable in the template file
    - If the template file contains `"template:<name>"`, the field `name` has to be specified in the values file

## Running rumbas
### Docker
The easiest way is to use docker.
- Get the docker image
  - Either Pull the latest image from [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/m8rex/rumbas): `docker pull m8rex/rumbas`
  - Or Clone this repo & Build the docker image with `docker build -t rumbas .`
- Run rumbas:`docker run --rm -it -v <absolute_path_to_folder with rumbas structure>:/rumbas m8rex/rumbas <relative path of exam in the mounted folder>`
  - Example `docker run --rm -it -v /Programming/rumbas/rumbas/examples/simple-example:/rumbas m8rex/rumbas exams/rumbas-exam-test.yaml`
  - Other Example `docker run --rm -it -v /Programming/rumbas/rumbas/examples/simple-example:/rumbas m8rex/rumbas questions/question1.yaml`
    - This compiles a single exercise by using the `template_exams/question_preview.yaml` template
  

### Without docker
- Make sure python 3 is installed (and added to the path)
- Clone numbas from https://github.com/numbas/Numbas
- Install rumbas
  - Build it yourself (see rumbas folder)
  - Download binaries (not yet available)
- Run rumbas
  - Make sure that the `NUMBAS_FOLDER` env variable is set to the root of the cloned Numbas repo
  - IMPORTANT: Themes don't work the right way yet, you need to make sure that de themes is added to the themes folder of your local numbas clone -> use Docker to not have this problem.
