# Rumbas (Rust + Numbas)

## What is Rumbas ?

- A system to create online exercises, build on top of numbas.
- Text-based: json (and html) specifications are converted to html files (e.g. scorm package)
  - So git can be used for version control ðŸŽ‰ 
- Consistent naming of fields in the json (not the case in numbas)
- Written in Rust

## Folder structure
A rumbas project should have to following folder structure:
  - A folder named `default` that contains the default specifications
  - A folder named `questions` that contains the questions
  - A folder named `exams` that contains the exams
  - A folder named `themes` the contains the themes
  - A folder named `custom_part_types` that contains `custom_part_types`

Rumbas does not specify default values by itself:
  - Users can (and should) use the `default` folder to specify their own default versions for different settings
  - By doing this, their question and exam specifications become much more concise.
  - Users can also create multiple versions of the default settings (e.g. a default setting for practice exams and a default setting for real exams)

The html input can be specified in two ways:
  - inline in the json,
  - in a separate html file (Recommended for larger jsons)
      - The value of the json field should then equal `file:<filename>`
This is also possible for the description of functions

Functions can be specified by just a filename:
  - Language is taken from the extension (`js` or `jme`)
  - file should start with comments of form `# param <name> <type>`
  - next should be the real definition

## Running rumbas
### Docker
The easiest way is to use docker.
- Clone this repo
- Build the docker image with `docker build -t rumbas .`
- Run rumbas:`docker run --rm -it -v <absolute_path_to_folder with rumbas structure>:/rumbas rumbas <relative path of exam in the mounted folder>`
  - Example `docker run --rm -it -v /Programming/rumbas/rumbas/examples/simple-example:/rumbas rumbas exams/rumbas-exam-test.json`

### Without docker
- Clone numbas from https://github.com/numbas/Numbas
- Set the `NUMBAS_FOLDER` env variable to the root of the cloned Numbas repo
- Install rumbas
  - Build it yourself (see rumbas folder)
  - Download binaries (not yet available)
- Run rumbas
  - TODO what with the themes?
