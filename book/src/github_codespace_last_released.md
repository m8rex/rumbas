# Running the last released version

- Log in to your Github account (or create one if you don't have one yet).
- Follow the steps  in [the rumbas codespaces template repo](https://github.com/m8rex/rumbas-codespaces-template) to load a github codespace with the latest released version of rumbas.
- You will now have a VSCode interface in your browser.
- Open a terminal within the VSCode interface and type `rumbas --version` to check if the setup is working.
- You can (after generating exams) use the installed Live Server extension to show the generated exams. Click on the 'Go Live' button in the right bottom corner.
