# Your first question

We will start your journey with rumbas by creating a simple question in the rumbas system. This question will be a simple calculation question. 


```admonish question title="Task"
Create a folder `first_question` in which we will create our 'rumbas project'. 
```

You can create a folder by right clicking on the left bar that shows the file system.
