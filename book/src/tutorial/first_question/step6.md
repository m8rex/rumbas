## Step 6: Try the exam

After starting your local webserver, you should be able to browse to the exam. You can find the url in the terminal. It should be something like `http://localhost:8000/en/exams/first_exam/`.
```admonish question title="Task"
Open the exam in your browser.
```

```admonish question title="Task"
Try answering the question and see if it works.
```

```admonish question title="Task"
Also try the following things:
- Reload the page and use the `Reveal answers` button to see the correct answer.
- Try the `Try another question like this one` button. It won't do anything yet, because we are not using variables yet.
```

You can also find the exam in the [online demo](https://m8rex.github.io/rumbas/examples/first_question/en/exams/first_exam/).
