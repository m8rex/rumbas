## Running the latest (non released) version

```admonish danger
This setup is not recommended. Only use this section if you want to test features of a rumbas version that is not yet released.
```

Log in to your Github account (or create one if you don't have one yet).


Click on the following link to open the examples of this book in Github Codespaces. You can then run the examples in the browser.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=265497289&machine=basicLinux32gb&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fexamples%2Fdevcontainer.json&location=WestEurope)

Github Codespaces will do the following:

- You can use the installed Live Server extension to show the generated exams. Click on the 'Go Live' button in the right bottom corner.
- You can use the 'Open folder' trick again to open a different example.
- You can close the codespace by clicking on 'Codespaces' in the left bottom corner and then clicking on 'Stop current codespace'.
